txt_to_obj.c
- Reads heightgrid from keyboard input and converts it to an .obj file (3D model file)

IMPORTANT: You must end every row with "666", and end the whole input with anything higher than or equal to "999".

Max size of terrain is now 64x64, you can change that in the variables "vertexno" and "rowstart" in the code.
